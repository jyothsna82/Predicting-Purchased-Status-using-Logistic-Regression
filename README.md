🧮 Predicting Purchased Status using Logistic Regression

This project demonstrates how to use **Logistic Regression** to predict whether a customer will purchase a product based on their **age** and **estimated salary**. It involves a complete machine learning pipeline—from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and visualization.


 🔍 Objective
To build a binary classification model that predicts whether a user purchases a product (1) or not (0) based on given features.

📊 Dataset Overview
* Features: `Age`, `EstimatedSalary`
* Target: `Purchased` (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

⚙️ Workflow
* Data Preprocessing (Standard Scaling)
* Train-Test Split
* Logistic Regression Model Training
* Model Evaluation using Confusion Matrix
* Decision Boundary Visualization

📈 Results
* Clear decision boundary visualization to show classification regions
* Confusion matrix to evaluate prediction performance

🛠️ Tech Stack
* Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, preprocessing, model selection)
